# Managed SeaTunnelX Java Proxy Service

## Why

`probe-once` works for install-time validation, but it is a poor fit for repeated storage diagnostics:

- every operation starts a new JVM
- file browsing and repeated probes become expensive
- later storage-tab interactions need a stable API surface

We therefore move toward a **managed seatunnelx-java-proxy service**.

## Target direction

The seatunnelx-java-proxy becomes a platform-managed component that:

- starts on the master node after install
- serves HTTP APIs for checkpoint / IMAP diagnostics
- is reused by both install-time probes and post-install storage inspection
- is later surfaced in the platform as a managed auxiliary service with status / restart / logs

## First-pass implementation in this change

This change implements the install-time foundation:

1. Runtime storage probes now **try a managed HTTP proxy service first**.
2. If the service is not available, installer code **falls back to existing `probe-once` CLI behavior**.
3. When SeaTunnel runtime has already been extracted, installer code can **lazy-start** a local proxy service by running:
   - `scripts/seatunnelx-java-proxy.sh`
   - with `-Dseatunnel.capability.proxy.port=<port>`
4. Service state is persisted under:
   - `<SEATUNNEL_HOME>/.seatunnelx/seatunnelx-java-proxy/`
   - including `service.port`, `service.pid`, and `service.log`

## Behavior

### Install-time probe path

For checkpoint / IMAP runtime probe:

1. use `SEATUNNELX_JAVA_PROXY_ENDPOINT` if explicitly configured
2. else reuse an already healthy local managed proxy service if found
3. else start a local managed proxy service lazily
4. if any of the above fails, fall back to `probe-once`

This keeps current installs backward compatible while enabling service-based probing.

## New environment knobs

- `SEATUNNELX_JAVA_PROXY_ENDPOINT`: force installer probes to use an existing proxy service
- `SEATUNNELX_JAVA_PROXY_PORT`: preferred port for the lazily started managed service

## What is not yet included

This first pass does **not** yet provide:

- control-plane start / stop / restart APIs
- health/state persistence in platform metadata
- UI exposure for proxy lifecycle management
- storage-tab list / stat / inspect APIs wired into the control plane

## Recommended next phases

### Phase 2: platform-managed lifecycle

- record proxy deployment/status per cluster
- add control-plane APIs for status / restart / logs
- auto-heal or auto-restart unhealthy proxy service

### Phase 3: storage inspector

- checkpoint / IMAP probe
- file listing
- size/stat operations
- later checkpoint deserialize / deep diagnostics
